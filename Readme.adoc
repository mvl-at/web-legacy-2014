= Musikverein Leopoldsdorf Legacy Website 2014

This is the legacy website from 2014. It exists for archivement purposes only.

== Setup
To run this website, just copy the sources into an apache instance.
Furthermore a MySQL conform database is required, which has to be configured in `system/mysqlauth.php`.
As this repository exists only for historical purposes a documentation for the database layout would be too much effort.
CAUTION: Since this website is very old it has many security issues, so the deployment is strongly NOT recommended.

== Picures
This repository does not include member pictures and never will.
Title pictures are included.
